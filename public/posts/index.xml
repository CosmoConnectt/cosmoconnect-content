      <description>&lt;p&gt;On July 20, 1969, NASA&amp;rsquo;s Apollo 11 mission made history when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon. The mission, commanded by Michael Collins, was the culmination of years of research, planning, and intense competition with the Soviet Union. Launched from Kennedy Space Center on July 16, Apollo 11 traveled over 384,000 kilometers (238,855 miles) to reach the lunar surface. Upon landing, Armstrong famously declared, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,&amp;rdquo; symbolizing a new era of space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dark Energy: The Force Behind Cosmic Expansion</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/darkenergy/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/darkenergy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dark energy is an unknown force that makes up about 68% of the universe and is responsible for its accelerated expansion. Unlike dark matter, which adds to the gravitational pull in the universe, dark energy works against gravity, pushing galaxies apart at an increasing rate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The existence of dark energy was first discovered in the late 1990s when astronomers studying distant supernovae found that their light was fainter than expected. This suggested that the universe’s expansion was speeding up rather than slowing down due to gravity. This discovery was groundbreaking and earned the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dark matter is one of the greatest mysteries in modern astrophysics. It is an invisible, unknown form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it undetectable through conventional telescopes. Despite this, its presence is inferred from its gravitational effects on galaxies and large-scale cosmic structures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept of dark matter was first proposed in the 1930s by Fritz Zwicky, who noticed that galaxy clusters were moving too fast to be held together by visible matter alone. Later observations of galaxy rotation curves by Vera Rubin in the 1970s provided further evidence that an unseen mass was influencing their movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched on December 25, 2021, is the most powerful space telescope ever built. A collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), JWST is designed to study the early universe, distant exoplanets, and the formation of galaxies and stars. It operates at the second Lagrange point (L2), approximately 1.5 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, JWST primarily observes in the infrared spectrum. This allows it to peer through cosmic dust and capture images of some of the oldest galaxies formed after the Big Bang. Its massive, gold-coated mirror, spanning 6.5 meters (21 feet), enables unprecedented clarity and detail in its observations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NASA’s twin Mars rovers, &lt;em&gt;Spirit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Opportunity&lt;/em&gt;, were launched in 2003 with the goal of exploring the Red Planet and searching for signs of past water activity. They landed on opposite sides of Mars in January 2004, with Spirit arriving in Gusev Crater and Opportunity touching down in Meridiani Planum. Initially planned for a 90-day mission, both rovers far exceeded expectations, with Opportunity lasting nearly 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spirit and Opportunity were equipped with scientific instruments to analyze Martian rocks, soil, and climate. Their most significant discovery was evidence that Mars once had liquid water on its surface. Opportunity found hematite-rich &amp;ldquo;blueberries,&amp;rdquo; a mineral that forms in water, confirming that Mars had a wetter past. Spirit discovered silica deposits, further supporting the idea that the planet once had hydrothermal activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Big Bang Theory is the leading explanation for the origin of the universe. It suggests that approximately 13.8 billion years ago, the universe began as an infinitely small, hot, and dense point known as a singularity. This singularity rapidly expanded in a process called cosmic inflation, giving rise to all the matter and energy that make up the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the universe expanded, it cooled, allowing subatomic particles to form. Within minutes, the first atomic nuclei emerged, primarily hydrogen and helium. Around 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe cooled enough for electrons to combine with nuclei, forming neutral atoms. This event, known as recombination, allowed light to travel freely, creating the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the oldest light in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, its atmosphere is toxic and its surface is extremely hot, making it inhospitable to life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;facts-about-venus&#34;&gt;Facts about Venus:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Venus has an atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Surface temperatures on Venus can reach up to 465°C, hotter than Mercury despite being farther from the Sun.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A day on Venus is longer than a year; it takes 243 Earth days to complete one rotation but only 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Venus is often seen as one of the most hostile planets in the Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Launched in 1977, NASA&amp;rsquo;s Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 missions were designed to explore the outer planets of our solar system and venture into interstellar space. The probes took advantage of a rare planetary alignment that occurs once every 176 years, allowing them to use gravitational assists to visit multiple planets. Voyager 2 launched first on August 20, followed by Voyager 1 on September 5. Although Voyager 1 launched later, it reached Jupiter and Saturn before Voyager 2 due to its faster trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Voyager missions, launched by NASA in 1977, remain one of humanity’s greatest achievements in space exploration. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were designed to explore the outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—but have since continued their journey beyond the solar system. These spacecraft have provided invaluable data about our cosmic neighborhood and are now humanity’s most distant emissaries in interstellar space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voyager 1, launched on September 5, 1977, flew past Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980 before heading toward the outer reaches of the solar system. In 2012, it became the first human-made object to enter interstellar space, crossing the heliopause, the boundary where the Sun’s influence ends. Voyager 2, launched on August 20, 1977, visited Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune before also entering interstellar space in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Space is full of weird and wonderful surprises. Despite decades of exploration, scientists continue to discover bizarre phenomena that challenge our understanding of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the strangest space facts is that there is a giant cloud of alcohol in space. Sagittarius B2, a massive gas cloud near the center of the Milky Way, contains vast amounts of ethyl alcohol, the same type found in alcoholic beverages. While you couldn’t drink it, it’s a reminder that complex molecules exist beyond Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
