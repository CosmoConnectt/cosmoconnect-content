      <description>&lt;p&gt;On July 20, 1969, NASA&amp;rsquo;s Apollo 11 mission made history when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon. The mission, commanded by Michael Collins, was the culmination of years of research, planning, and intense competition with the Soviet Union. Launched from Kennedy Space Center on July 16, Apollo 11 traveled over 384,000 kilometers (238,855 miles) to reach the lunar surface. Upon landing, Armstrong famously declared, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,&amp;rdquo; symbolizing a new era of space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to journey into outer space, marking a significant milestone in the Space Race. Gagarin was selected from a group of highly trained pilots for the mission, which was conducted under strict secrecy. The spacecraft, &lt;em&gt;Vostok 1&lt;/em&gt;, launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and completed one orbit around Earth, reaching an altitude of 327 kilometers (203 miles). The entire mission lasted approximately 108 minutes, making Gagarin an international hero and a symbol of Soviet technological prowess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was launched aboard the Space Shuttle &lt;em&gt;Discovery&lt;/em&gt; on April 24, 1990, and has since become one of the most important astronomical instruments ever built. Orbiting at approximately 547 kilometers (340 miles) above Earth, Hubble provides an unobstructed view of the cosmos, free from atmospheric interference. This allows it to capture images in visible, ultraviolet, and near-infrared wavelengths, revealing details about the universe that were previously beyond our reach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Space Station (ISS) is one of the most ambitious collaborative projects in human history, involving space agencies from the United States (NASA), Russia (Roscosmos), Europe (ESA), Japan (JAXA), and Canada (CSA). Since its first module was launched in 1998, the ISS has served as a permanent research facility orbiting Earth at an altitude of approximately 420 kilometers (260 miles). It has hosted astronauts continuously since November 2000, making it one of the longest-running human spaceflight missions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched on December 25, 2021, is the most powerful space telescope ever built. A collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), JWST is designed to study the early universe, distant exoplanets, and the formation of galaxies and stars. It operates at the second Lagrange point (L2), approximately 1.5 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, JWST primarily observes in the infrared spectrum. This allows it to peer through cosmic dust and capture images of some of the oldest galaxies formed after the Big Bang. Its massive, gold-coated mirror, spanning 6.5 meters (21 feet), enables unprecedented clarity and detail in its observations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mars Rovers: Spirit and Opportunity</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/marsrover/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NASA’s twin Mars rovers, &lt;em&gt;Spirit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Opportunity&lt;/em&gt;, were launched in 2003 with the goal of exploring the Red Planet and searching for signs of past water activity. They landed on opposite sides of Mars in January 2004, with Spirit arriving in Gusev Crater and Opportunity touching down in Meridiani Planum. Initially planned for a 90-day mission, both rovers far exceeded expectations, with Opportunity lasting nearly 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spirit and Opportunity were equipped with scientific instruments to analyze Martian rocks, soil, and climate. Their most significant discovery was evidence that Mars once had liquid water on its surface. Opportunity found hematite-rich &amp;ldquo;blueberries,&amp;rdquo; a mineral that forms in water, confirming that Mars had a wetter past. Spirit discovered silica deposits, further supporting the idea that the planet once had hydrothermal activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Perseverance Rover and the Search for Life on Mars</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NASA’s &lt;em&gt;Perseverance&lt;/em&gt; rover landed on Mars on February 18, 2021, as part of the Mars 2020 mission. It was designed to explore the Jezero Crater, a region believed to have once contained a lake, making it an ideal location to search for signs of ancient microbial life. Perseverance is equipped with advanced scientific instruments to analyze rocks, collect soil samples, and search for biosignatures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A key feature of the mission is the Sample Caching System, which collects and stores Martian rock samples for a future return mission to Earth. Scientists hope that these samples will provide crucial evidence of past life and insights into Mars’ geological history. The rover is also testing new technologies, including a system for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, which could support future human exploration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NASA’s Artemis program is an ambitious initiative to return humans to the Moon and establish a long-term lunar presence. Named after the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology, Artemis seeks to build on the legacy of the Apollo missions while incorporating modern technology and international collaboration. The program’s ultimate goal is to pave the way for human exploration of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Artemis I, the first uncrewed test flight of the &lt;em&gt;Space Launch System (SLS)&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Orion&lt;/em&gt; spacecraft, launched successfully in 2022. Artemis II, scheduled for the mid-2020s, will carry astronauts around the Moon without landing. Artemis III will mark humanity’s return to the lunar surface, with astronauts landing near the Moon’s south pole, where water ice has been detected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Voyager Missions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Launched in 1977, NASA&amp;rsquo;s Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 missions were designed to explore the outer planets of our solar system and venture into interstellar space. The probes took advantage of a rare planetary alignment that occurs once every 176 years, allowing them to use gravitational assists to visit multiple planets. Voyager 2 launched first on August 20, followed by Voyager 1 on September 5. Although Voyager 1 launched later, it reached Jupiter and Saturn before Voyager 2 due to its faster trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Voyager Missions: Humanity’s Message to the Stars</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Voyager missions, launched by NASA in 1977, remain one of humanity’s greatest achievements in space exploration. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were designed to explore the outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—but have since continued their journey beyond the solar system. These spacecraft have provided invaluable data about our cosmic neighborhood and are now humanity’s most distant emissaries in interstellar space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voyager 1, launched on September 5, 1977, flew past Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980 before heading toward the outer reaches of the solar system. In 2012, it became the first human-made object to enter interstellar space, crossing the heliopause, the boundary where the Sun’s influence ends. Voyager 2, launched on August 20, 1977, visited Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune before also entering interstellar space in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
