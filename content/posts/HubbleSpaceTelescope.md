The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was launched aboard the Space Shuttle *Discovery* on April 24, 1990, and has since become one of the most important astronomical instruments ever built. Orbiting at approximately 547 kilometers (340 miles) above Earth, Hubble provides an unobstructed view of the cosmos, free from atmospheric interference. This allows it to capture images in visible, ultraviolet, and near-infrared wavelengths, revealing details about the universe that were previously beyond our reach.

Hubble’s journey was not without challenges. Shortly after deployment, scientists discovered a flaw in its primary mirror, which caused blurred images. However, NASA launched a servicing mission in 1993 to install corrective optics, effectively fixing the problem. Over the years, Hubble has been serviced multiple times by astronauts, upgrading its instruments and extending its lifespan. These missions ensured that Hubble remained a cutting-edge observatory well into the 21st century.

The telescope has contributed to many groundbreaking discoveries. It played a crucial role in determining the rate of the universe’s expansion, leading to the discovery of dark energy. Hubble’s deep-field images have revealed thousands of galaxies in a tiny patch of sky, helping astronomers understand the evolution of galaxies over billions of years. It has also provided stunning images of nebulae, star-forming regions, and exoplanets, expanding our knowledge of the cosmos.

One of Hubble’s most famous images is the *Pillars of Creation*, a breathtaking view of towering clouds of gas and dust in the Eagle Nebula. These images have not only advanced scientific understanding but have also inspired the public and deepened humanity’s appreciation for the beauty of space. Hubble has also observed the atmospheres of exoplanets, providing insights into their composition and potential habitability.

Although Hubble is expected to remain operational for a few more years, it will eventually be succeeded by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which launched in 2021. Despite this, Hubble’s legacy will endure as one of the greatest astronomical achievements of all time. Its contributions to science and its impact on our understanding of the universe will continue to inspire future generations of explorers and scientists.
