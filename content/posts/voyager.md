Launched in 1977, NASA's Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 missions were designed to explore the outer planets of our solar system and venture into interstellar space. The probes took advantage of a rare planetary alignment that occurs once every 176 years, allowing them to use gravitational assists to visit multiple planets. Voyager 2 launched first on August 20, followed by Voyager 1 on September 5. Although Voyager 1 launched later, it reached Jupiter and Saturn before Voyager 2 due to its faster trajectory.

The Voyager probes provided humanity with its first close-up images of the outer planets. Voyager 1 studied Jupiter and Saturn, revealing details such as Jupiter’s turbulent atmosphere and Saturn’s complex ring system. Voyager 2, following a different path, conducted the only close-up flybys of Uranus and Neptune, unveiling their icy compositions, magnetic fields, and unique moon systems. The missions revolutionized our understanding of the gas giants and their moons, discovering features such as active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io and geysers on Neptune’s moon Triton.

One of the most famous aspects of the Voyager missions is the Golden Record, a time capsule designed to communicate with potential extraterrestrial life. Curated by a team led by Carl Sagan, the record contains sounds, images, and greetings from Earth in multiple languages, along with music and natural sounds. It serves as a message from humanity to any intelligent life that might one day encounter the spacecraft.

Voyager 1 became the first human-made object to enter interstellar space in 2012, followed by Voyager 2 in 2018. Even though their primary mission was completed decades ago, both probes continue to send valuable data about cosmic rays, solar winds, and the boundary of our solar system. Their instruments, though aging, provide insights into the nature of the space beyond our sun’s influence.

The Voyager probes remain symbols of human curiosity and exploration. Despite their distance of over 20 billion kilometers (12 billion miles) from Earth, they continue to communicate with NASA. Their extended missions may last until the late 2020s before power runs out. The data they provide will continue to shape our understanding of space, inspiring future generations to explore the cosmos.
