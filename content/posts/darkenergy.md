Dark energy is an unknown force that makes up about 68% of the universe and is responsible for its accelerated expansion. Unlike dark matter, which adds to the gravitational pull in the universe, dark energy works against gravity, pushing galaxies apart at an increasing rate.

The existence of dark energy was first discovered in the late 1990s when astronomers studying distant supernovae found that their light was fainter than expected. This suggested that the universeâ€™s expansion was speeding up rather than slowing down due to gravity. This discovery was groundbreaking and earned the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics.

One possible explanation for dark energy is the cosmological constant, a term originally introduced by Albert Einstein in his equations of General Relativity. Einstein later dismissed it as his "biggest blunder," but modern observations suggest that a similar concept may actually be responsible for cosmic acceleration.

Another theory proposes that dark energy is a dynamic force, possibly linked to a new field known as quintessence. Others suggest that our understanding of gravity itself may need revision at cosmic scales.

Dark energy remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in cosmology. Understanding its nature could reshape our knowledge of fundamental physics and provide insights into the ultimate fate of the universe.
