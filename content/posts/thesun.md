# The Sun

The Sun is a massive ball of hot, glowing gas that is the center of the Solar System. It is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium and generates energy through nuclear fusion in its core. This process produces the light and heat that make life on Earth possible.

## Facts about the Sun:
- The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.
- It is approximately 4.6 billion years old and is expected to remain stable for another 5 billion years.
- The temperature at the Sun's core is about 15 million degrees Celsius.
- The Sun's gravity is strong enough to keep the entire Solar System in orbit.

The Sun plays a crucial role in weather patterns, climate, and the growth of plants on Earth, among other things.
