Dark matter is one of the greatest mysteries in modern astrophysics. It is an invisible, unknown form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it undetectable through conventional telescopes. Despite this, its presence is inferred from its gravitational effects on galaxies and large-scale cosmic structures.

The concept of dark matter was first proposed in the 1930s by Fritz Zwicky, who noticed that galaxy clusters were moving too fast to be held together by visible matter alone. Later observations of galaxy rotation curves by Vera Rubin in the 1970s provided further evidence that an unseen mass was influencing their movement.

Scientists estimate that dark matter constitutes about 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content, while ordinary matter makes up only 5%. The remaining 68% consists of dark energy, another cosmic mystery. Current theories suggest that dark matter could be composed of hypothetical particles such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) or axions.

Experiments around the world, including underground detectors and space observatories, are searching for direct evidence of dark matter. While its exact nature remains unknown, solving this mystery could revolutionize our understanding of physics.

Dark matter plays a crucial role in shaping the universeâ€™s structure. Without it, galaxies might not have formed as they did. As research continues, uncovering the secrets of dark matter will be a major breakthrough in cosmology and particle physics.
