# Venus

Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's "sister planet" because of its similar size and composition. However, its atmosphere is toxic and its surface is extremely hot, making it inhospitable to life.

## Facts about Venus:
- Venus has an atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid.
- Surface temperatures on Venus can reach up to 465Â°C, hotter than Mercury despite being farther from the Sun.
- A day on Venus is longer than a year; it takes 243 Earth days to complete one rotation but only 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun.

Venus is often seen as one of the most hostile planets in the Solar System.
