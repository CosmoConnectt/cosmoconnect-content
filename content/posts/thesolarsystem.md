# The Solar System

The Solar System is a collection of celestial bodies, including the Sun, eight planets, their moons, and various smaller objects like dwarf planets, comets, and asteroids. All of these objects are bound by gravity, and they orbit the Sun.

The Sun is at the center of the Solar System, providing the necessary light and heat to sustain life on Earth. The planets are divided into two categories: the inner planets, which are rocky and include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars; and the outer planets, which are gas giants and include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

Beyond the planets lies the Kuiper Belt, which is home to dwarf planets like Pluto, and the Oort Cloud, a distant region that is thought to be the source of long-period comets.

The Solar System also contains an abundance of smaller objects such as asteroids and comets that can be found in the asteroid belt, as well as scattered throughout the outer reaches of the system.

## Key Features:
- The Sun is the largest object, accounting for 99.86% of the mass in the Solar System.
- The planets follow elliptical orbits around the Sun, with varying lengths and distances.
- The Solar System extends far beyond Neptune, with many smaller objects residing in the outer reaches.
