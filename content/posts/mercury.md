# Mercury

Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is the smallest planet in the Solar System. It has extreme temperature fluctuations because it has no atmosphere to retain heat.

## Facts about Mercury:
- Mercury has a surface temperature ranging from -173°C at night to 427°C during the day.
- It has no moons or rings.
- A year on Mercury lasts only 88 Earth days, but a day on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days.
- Mercury has a heavily cratered surface, similar to the Moon.

Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury has no atmosphere, making it a hostile environment for life.
