Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun. It is a gas giant with a deep blue color due to methane in its atmosphere. It has the fastest winds recorded in the Solar System.

## Facts about Neptune:
- Neptuneâ€™s winds can reach speeds of up to 2,100 km/h.
- It has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and having a retrograde orbit.
