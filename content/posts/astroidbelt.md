# The Asteroid Belt

The Asteroid Belt is a region of space located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, filled with millions of rocky objects. These objects range in size from tiny dust particles to large asteroids.

## Facts about the Asteroid Belt:
- The largest asteroid, Ceres, is also classified as a dwarf planet.
- The belt contains many irregularly shaped asteroids composed of rock, metal, and ice.
- Some asteroids have their own moons.
- Scientists believe that the belt is made of leftover material from the formation of the Solar System.

The Asteroid Belt is an important region for studying the early Solar System and potential resources for future space exploration.
