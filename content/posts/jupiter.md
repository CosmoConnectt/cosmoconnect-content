# Jupiter

Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System and the fifth planet from the Sun. It is a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with a thick atmosphere filled with powerful storms, including the famous Great Red Spot.

## Facts about Jupiter:
- Jupiter is 318 times the mass of Earth.
- It has at least 79 moons, with the four largest being Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
- Jupiter has the shortest day of any planet, completing a full rotation in about 10 hours.
- Its Great Red Spot is a massive storm that has been raging for over 300 years.

Jupiter plays a significant role in protecting the inner planets by attracting and deflecting comets and asteroids with its strong gravitational pull.
