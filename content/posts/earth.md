# Earth

Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. It has a diverse environment with oceans, mountains, forests, and deserts, all of which are maintained by a delicate balance of atmospheric gases and climate conditions.

## Facts about Earth:
- Earth has a breathable atmosphere made of nitrogen, oxygen, and trace gases.
- The planet's surface is 71% water, with oceans covering most of the surface.
- Earth has one natural satellite: the Moon.
- The average surface temperature is around 14°C.

Earth’s magnetic field protects it from harmful solar radiation, and its unique combination of atmosphere and liquid water is essential for life.
