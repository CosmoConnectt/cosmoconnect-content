The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched on December 25, 2021, is the most powerful space telescope ever built. A collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), JWST is designed to study the early universe, distant exoplanets, and the formation of galaxies and stars. It operates at the second Lagrange point (L2), approximately 1.5 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Earth.

Unlike its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, JWST primarily observes in the infrared spectrum. This allows it to peer through cosmic dust and capture images of some of the oldest galaxies formed after the Big Bang. Its massive, gold-coated mirror, spanning 6.5 meters (21 feet), enables unprecedented clarity and detail in its observations.

One of JWST’s primary goals is to study exoplanet atmospheres, searching for signs of habitability and potential life. Its instruments can detect water vapor, methane, and other key molecules in distant planetary systems. It has already made groundbreaking discoveries, including detailed observations of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, the composition of exoplanet atmospheres, and images of early galaxies.

JWST’s data is reshaping our understanding of the cosmos. Its ability to see deeper into space and further back in time allows astronomers to study galaxy evolution, star formation, and the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy. The telescope’s findings are expected to revolutionize many areas of astrophysics.

With a planned mission lifespan of at least 10 years, JWST will continue to uncover new cosmic phenomena, providing humanity with an unprecedented view of the universe. As technology advances, its discoveries will guide future space missions and deepen our knowledge of the vast universe.
